config NET_VENDOR_QUALCOMM
    bool "Qualcomm devices"
    default y
    ---help---
      If you have a network (Ethernet) card belonging to this class, say Y
      and read the Ethernet-HOWTO, available from
      <http://www.tldp.org/docs.html#howto>.

      Note that the answer to this question doesn't directly affect the
      kernel: saying N will just cause the configurator to skip all
      the questions about Qualcomm cards. If you say Y, you will be asked
      for your specific card in the following questions.

if NET_VENDOR_QUALCOMM

config SHORTCUT_FE
	tristate "Qualcomm/Atheros shortcut forward engine"
	select NF_CONNTRACK
	select NF_CONNTRACK_MARK
	select NF_CONNTRACK_CHAIN_EVENTS
	---help---
	  This driver provides support for accelerated "shortcut" packet forwarding.

	  The module will be called sfe.
