* OCTEON SD/MMC Host Controller

This controller is present on some members of the Cavium OCTEON SoC
family, provide an interface for eMMC, MMC and SD devices.  There is a
single controller that may have several "slots" connected.  These
slots appear as children of the main controller node.

Required properties:
- compatible : Should be "cavium,octeon-6130-mmc"
- reg : Two entries:
	1) The base address of the MMC controller register bank.
	2) The base address of the MMC DMA engine register bank.
- interrupts : Two entries:
	1) The MMC controller interrupt line.
	2) The MMC DMA engine interrupt line.
- #address-cells : Must be <1>
- #size-cells : Must be <0>

Required properties of child nodes:
- compatible : Should be "cavium,octeon-6130-mmc-slot".
- reg : The slot number.
- cavium,bus-max-width : The number of data lines present in the slot.
- spi-max-frequency : The maximum operating frequency of the slot.

Optional properties of child nodes:
- cd-gpios : Specify GPIOs for card detection
- wp-gpios : Specify GPIOs for write protection
- power-gpios : Specify GPIOs for power control

Example:
	mmc@1180000002000 {
		compatible = "cavium,octeon-6130-mmc";
		reg = <0x11800 0x00002000 0x0 0x100>,
		      <0x11800 0x00000168 0x0 0x20>;
		#address-cells = <1>;
		#size-cells = <0>;
		/* EMM irq, DMA irq */
		interrupts = <1 19>, <0 63>;

		/* The board only has a single MMC slot */
		mmc-slot@0 {
			compatible = "cavium,octeon-6130-mmc-slot";
			reg = <0>;
			spi-max-frequency = <20000000>;
			/* bus width can be 1, 4 or 8 */
			cavium,bus-max-width = <8>;
			cd-gpios = <&gpio 9 0>;
			wp-gpios = <&gpio 10 0>;
			power-gpios = <&gpio 8 0>;
		};
	};
